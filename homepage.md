I'm M.Sc. student at [Systems and Computing Department](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/) at [Federal University of Campina Grande](http://www.ufcg.edu.br/).

My interests include distributed systems (especially, MapReduce and NoSQL), game development, software tests, algorithms and programming languages.

Research
--------

I work as research assistant with [Francisco Brasileiro](http://fubica.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/) in the [Distributed Systems Laboratory](http://www.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/). My research concentrates on the design and implementation of the distributed file system BeeFS, which harnesses the free disk space of desktop machines already deployed in a corporation to build a efficient and scalable storage solution in a cheaper way.

In previous research, I have focused on challenges in implementation of [Nodewiz](http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Sung-Ju_Lee/abstracts/papers/gp2pc2005.pdf)'s improvements. Nodewiz is a scalable peer-to-peer and fault-tolerant resource and service discovery for overlay networks and grids that supports multi-attribute and range queries. This work are done jointly with [Lauro Beltrão](http://sites.google.com/site/lbeltrao/).
