* [Google Docs File System][gdocsfs] provides a mountable Linux filesystem which uses your Google Docs account as its storage medium.

* [FrogstarB][]: Simple tool to post to [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) from the command line. Itâ€™s a very easy way to format your content without writing any HTML. You give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it transforms your text and post to Blogger.

* [Stats-tools][]: A set of command-line tools for statisticians.

* [rails_completion][]: Bash completion support for Ruby on Rails.

Some of the projects I have worked on in the past are available [here](/past_projects.html).
