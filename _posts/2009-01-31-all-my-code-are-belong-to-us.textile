title: All My Code Are Belong to Us
summary: A blog is born.

I've really been pushing myself to move as much code as possible into the public space. <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> has come at a perfect time to encourage this behavior. It makes the tedious process of sharing code so easy you'd be stupid not to.

I put all of it <a href="http://github.com/jqr">directly on GitHub</a> as a Rails plugin and a Ruby gem. Learning how to do this is a few hours of investment, but it's an investment you only need to make once. I'm using <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/echoe/files/README.html">Echoe</a> right now, but I'll probably switch to <a href="http://technicalpickles.com/posts/craft-the-perfect-gem-with-jeweler">Jeweler</a> for even simpler releases.

I am certain that making code reusable is one of the best ways to gain a solid understanding of how a software developer's tools should be used. Polishing up code for public release encourages a ton of good behavior that makes even personal reuse easier and as a side benefit, other people will improve my code for free!

Most of the plugins and gems I write are simple enhancements to patterns and are the result of DRYing up code in a single project. After abstracting the initial idea from one project, I find it's much easier to recognize the same pattern in other projects.

So take a few minutes and look for patterns in your code. Give the pattern a name. Uncover the simplest way to express it. Start using it. Discover it's limitations. Publish it. Talk about it.
